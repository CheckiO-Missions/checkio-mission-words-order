        You need to match each word of the string with a word in the words list. If there is one, then remember it,
        and at the end just compare the words that were taken from the string with the words from the list.

        As an algorithm that will find the necessary words and store them, I suggest using a set generator.
         It will help us bypass the problem of repeating a word in a line.
        <pre class="brush: python">
text = "hi world im here hi world world im here"
result = {i for i in text.split()}
print(result)

# output
{'im', 'hi', 'world', 'here'}
        </pre>
        Although all words occur more than once in a string, our result contains one instance of each word.
         But be careful, the set is not an ordered data type.

        You can add an if condition inside to the set generator expression. Therefore, only those elements that
        pass the expression of the if condition will be added to the generator result. In our if condition, we will
        add a check for occurrence of a word from the string in the list of words.
        <pre class="brush: python">
text = "hi world im here hi world world im here"
words = ["world", "here"]
result = {i for i in text.split() if i in words}
print(result)

# output
{'world', 'here'}

        All we have to do is check whether the words we received by the set generator are in the same order as in the
        list of words. The sorted() function and the str.index() method will help us. This str.index() method returns
        the index of the first element that matched the given element in the parentheses. But we will use this method
        as the value of the "key" argument in the sorted() function. Look carefully =)
        <pre class="brush: python">
text = "hi world im here hi world world im here"
words = ["world", "here"]
result = {i for i in text.split() if i in words}
print(sorted(result, key=text.index))

# output
['world', 'here']
        </pre>
        The sorted() function turned our set into a list and sorted it by text.index('world') ... text.index('here').
         That is, the output is a list with the order of words, as in the specified line. Thus, we solved the problem of unordered set data type.

        All you have to do is wrap all the code in a function expression. And at the output of the function, return
        the value of the comparison of the sorted list and the list of words.
        <pre class="brush: python">
def words_order(text: str, words: list) -> bool:
    result = {i for i in text.split() if i in words}
    print(result)
    return sorted(result, key=text.index) == words

        Okay, okay! That's the spirit!=)
        Here is an example of a solution through for loops. The logic is very similar to our solution,
        but instead of the set, we check whether our text_new list contains specific words or not.
        <pre class="brush: python">
def words_order(text: str, words: list) -> bool:
    if len(set(words)) < len(words):
        return False
    text_new = []
    for i in text.split():
        if i in words and i not in text_new:
            text_new.append(i)
    return text_new == words
        </pre>
    </div>
