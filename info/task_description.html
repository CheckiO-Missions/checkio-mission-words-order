</p>

<p> Cases you should expect while solving this challenge:</p>

<ul>
    <li>a word from the list is not in the text - your function should return False;</li>

    <li>two words in the given list are the same - your function should return False;</li>
    <li>the condition is case sensitive, which means 'hi' and 'Hi' are two different words;</li>
    <li>the text includes only English letters and spaces.</li>
</ul>
